The aim of this project was to consolidate all my front end skills and build a responsive wensite using only HTML and CSS, no frameworks.

One of the most useful skills that I gained through this project was getting comfortable using chrome dev tools.

I gained a better understanding of how to sructure my HTML for a bigger website. The CSS is not very organised, but this project allowed me to learn and practice using breakpoints.
